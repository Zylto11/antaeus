that aims to be powerful for experts while still being easy to use for beginners.

# Philosophy

Antaeus aims to be an easy to use, batteries-included framework for teams to
easily implement. As Vex Robotics has become more competitive in the recent
years, teams have been allocating lesser time for programmers to program their
robots. This framework/library is designed to be easy and faster to implement.

## Comparison with Evian

[Evian](https://github.com/vexide/evian) is a complete framework based on [Vexide](https://vexide.dev)
as well what Antaeus was inspired by. It aims to be a extensible framework that
is easy to use as well. However, Antaeus aims to be less extensible and more of
an all-rounded framework, not only for autonomous motion but for advanced
driver control operations. To ensure the best results, please carefully select
the library you plan to use before continuing.

## A Notice before using Antaeus

It is important that you understand concepts used in this library such as
Odometry and Pure Pursuit. This library aims to be simple to implement but
expects you to understand these concepts before using it and therefore learn
more in the process. Please do not just "plug in" this library and use it
without thinking much. If you have new ideas, you are really really encouraged
to contribute to this library and/or create your own library. More on
contribution can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
